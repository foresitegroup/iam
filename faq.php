  <strong><span class="redtext">Q:</span> Does Investment Account Manager accurately derive investment performance?</strong><br>
  <br>

  Investment Account Manager calculates the modified IRR method to derive the internal rate of return for investment performance. This method calculates return for the period taking into effect the exact timing of each external cash flow. The model properly weights the timing of cash flows (additions/ withdrawals) for a portfolio or an individual asset, for a selected date range, to provide the return calculation.
