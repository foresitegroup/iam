    Since 1985 we have offered our customers the best portfolio management software the industry has to offer, and a large part of why our software is critically acclaimed is due to how safe and secure your information is.<br>
    <br>

    Our software is based around the idea that your information is your own and no one else's. We don't have access to it, we can't download it and your information isn't cloud based. Your information is stored safely and securely on your home computer, and to keep your information safe and secure, we want to outline a few options you have to make sure your files and information are safely backed up in case of a computer malfunction or the dreaded spilled coffee.

  <div class="subtitle">THE BEST WAYS TO BACKUP</div>

  <h2>External Memory Device</h2>
  This is one of the best options for storing important and vital information because they can hold large files, are easy to use and they're no bigger than your wallet. Many External Hard Drives and Flash Drives offer another barrier to access, like asking for a password to simply open the folders on the hard drive. <br>
  <br>

  <strong>Key Features:</strong> Small in size, Inexpensive, Easy to use, Highly Secure (Password Protected), Large amount of storage space, Ability to back up entire computer.

  <h2>Google Drive or Dropbox</h2>
  <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a> offer easy, and free, alternatives to external hard drives and flash drives. This is a great option for users who have minimal space on their computers or aren't ready to make the small investment of an external hard drive. All Dropbox and Google Drive storage services are secure and need a user created password to access your information, much like the external hard drives.<br>
  <br>

  <strong>Key Features:</strong> Free to use, Highly Secure (Password Protected), Large amount of storage space, Cloud Storage, Easy to use.<br>
