    <h1>REINSTALLING INVESTMENT ACCOUNT MANAGER ON A SECOND COMPUTER</h1>
  </article>
</div>

<article>
  The Investment Account Manager (IAM) User License allows our customers to install IAM on a 2nd backup computer, as well as on a primary computer.  It also allows for the reinstallation of the program in the event of computer malfunction.<br>
  <br>

  In order to reinstall IAM, the process requires the download of the most recent trial version from our website, a previously made IAM Backup from the primary computer, and an active support policy (if after 1 year of the date of the original purchase).<br>
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>To make the IAM Backup, select the File Menu | Backup data.<br><br></li>
    <li>Backup the data files, which includes your current support license activations, to a portable drive, i.e. a plug-in drive.<br><br></li>
    <li>Next, download and install the most recent trial version onto the destination computer.<br><br></li>
    <li>Start the trial version and select the File Menu | Restore data.  Look to the portable drive used to make the backup.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  That's all there is to it.<br>
