  <strong>Converting IAM2 data to IAM3</strong><br>
  Prior to converting your IAM2 data to IAM3, we recommend making a backup of your current IAM2 data.<br>
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>Start your copy of IAM2, and use the file menu | backup data choice | backing up your data to a removable drive.<br><br></li>
    <li>Close IAM2.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  When you are ready, you can then convert your existing IAM2 data to IAM3.  Note: your IAM2 data will remain unchanged and intact for continued use in IAM2 to shadow entry activity while using IAM3.<br>
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>Start the IAM3 demo.<br><br></li>
    <li>
      Select the file menu | convert IAM2 Individual into IAM3 Individual.<br>
      <br>

    </li>
    <li>Select the OK button when prompted to continue with the conversion of your IAM2 individual data into IAM3 Individual version.<br><br></li>
    <li>
      If you used the original default location for your IAM2 installation, your portfolios should be listed for conversion. Select the '<strong>Convert Now</strong>' button.<br>
      <br>

      <br>

      <ul><li>Note:  If you did not use the original default location for IAM2, use the 'Directory' button to locate the installation directory for your current copy of IAM2, and then select the \Data folder. Your portfolios should be listed for conversion.  Select the '<strong>Convert Now</strong>' button.</li></ul>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>All existing portfolio data will be migrated to IAM3, and IAM3 will be activated to a full version, provided your IAM2 support is up-to-date and active.<br><br></li>
    <li>We suggest you use IAM3 for a couple of months in shadow to your regular use of IAM2, verifying activity, updating, and reporting.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
