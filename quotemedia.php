  Investment Account Manager makes the process of entering new assets into the software very efficient when using the QuoteMedia&trade; data feed. Fundamental and descriptive data is automatically retrieved and entered for the user. This fundamental data includes: security name, market price, earnings per share, dividends per share, security beta, book value per share, cash flow per share, industry sector and stock size. This data, when incorporated into Investment Account Manager, provides the information for powerful fundamental stock analysis, screening and asset allocation<br>

  Subscribers to the QuoteMedia data feed can globally update all stocks, funds and ETF's in the IAM asset library. This function is particularly helpful at month end, so that with just a few simple clicks, your investments reflect updated fundamental and descriptive data.<br>

  Investment Account Manager derives fundamental ratios using data provided by the QuoteMedia data feed. Fundamental ratio analysis offers a "snap shot" of a company's value, where the analysis is a review of a firm's financial report. Investors will find the set of informative ratios helpful in discovering undervalued securities, especially since the valuation ratios table can be sorted in either ascending or descending order. For example, if you wanted to sort your asset library based upon dividend yield, listing the higher yielding stocks first, with just a couple of mouse clicks you'll have the sort order as you requested. <a href="pdf/QuoteMedia_Sample_Report.pdf">View a sample report.</a><br>

  A successful approach to investing in common stocks includes the ability for investors to set target allocations for their stock holdings based on sector and size, and then identify rebalancing needs for their portfolio. The QuoteMedia data feed provides stock sector and size to help users easily populate these classifications automatically.<br>
