  Download the IAM2 Utility Program if you are having a problem with your previously installed version of Investment Account Manager.  The IAM2 Utility Program should be installed to the same directory where Investment Account Manager is currently installed.  If you used our default location when first installing IAM, this utility is defaulted to install to this same directory.<br>
  <br>
  
  IAM2 Utilities will provide the following tools and will attempt to repair errors when running Investment Account Manager.<br>

  <strong>Backup Data:</strong> If you cannot start IAM and wish to backup your data, select this option.<br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>Fix Portfolio Memo Fields:</strong> If you are getting an error that shows that the memo file is missing or invalid, run this utility. This is error 41.<br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>Pack &amp; Reindex Database:</strong> Packing files removed deleted records and compacts notes. This will reduce the size of the files and speed up the program.<br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>Portfolio Diagnostic:</strong> This diagnostic tool will scan all portfolios in Investment Account Manager, identifying discrepancies between the quantity shown on reports and the quantity calculated on the Portfolio Activity Ledger.<br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>Register Crystal Reports Controls:</strong> If you can't get reports to display, you may need to re-register the Crystal Reports controls. This program should find the correct directory to register these controls.<br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>Register OLE Controls &mdash; Run as Administrator:</strong> Re-register all of the OLE controls. You must have administrator privileges to register OLE controls. When starting the utility program, right-click and choose "Run as Admin" if you are using a Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8 machine.<br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>Repair Corrupted Files:</strong> If you can't open the program because the program says that it is already running, this should correct the problem.<br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>Update Program:</strong> If you downloaded a newer version of the program, but the program will not update because it is installed under \Program Files, use this program to install the update.<br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>View Error Log:</strong> If a program error occurs while using Investment Account Manager, an entry of the error is automatically created in the error log. Any error can be printed or saved to your clipboard to send to technical support (<?php email("techsupport@investmentaccountmanager.com"); ?>).<br>
